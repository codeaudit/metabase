              # The following columns are foreign keys, but we don't keep FK constraints on them for a few reasons:
              # - We don't want to keep indexes on these columns since they wouldn't be generally useful and for size and performance reasons
              # - If a related object (e.g. a Dashboard) is deleted, we don't want to delete the related entries in the QueryExecution log.
              #   We could do something like make the constraint ON DELETE SET NULL, but that would require a full table scan to handle;
              #   If the QueryExecution log became tens of millions of rows large it would take a very long time to scan and update records
